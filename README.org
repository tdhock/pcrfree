** TODOs

Look at genome coverage plots and label regions where there are
visually obvious differences between PCR and PCRFree.

[[file:gc.coverage.R]] reads data from abacus.

[[file:figure-gc-coverage.R]] makes the following plot

[[file:figure-gc-coverage.png]]

The figures indicates that there are no 10KB bins which have very
different coverage, between PCR and PCRFree. If there are any
differences, then their signal is most likely lower than the noise of
the coverage in these 10KB bins.
